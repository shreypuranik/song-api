# song-api

This is a Symfony based api app which retrieves song information from the connected MySQL database. 

To run it locally, you can use a pre-defined environment like my [symfony-docker-skeleton](https://github.com/shreypuranik/symfony-docker-skeleton) and clone this app into the 'app' directory within the symfony-docker-skeleton project locally. 

## Endpoints 

### GET /song

Access via ```/song``` to see list of songs with artist and song_id values.
